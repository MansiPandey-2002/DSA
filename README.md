# DSA Internal Implementations

## Introduction

Welcome to the internal implementations of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C. This repository contains various code snippets of DSA implementations and how they all work behind the scenes.
## Table of Contents

- **Searching Techniques**
- **Sorting Algorithms**
- **Stacks**
  - `stack.c`: Implementation of a stack (Creation, Insertion, Deletion, Display) in C.
- **Queues**
  - `queue.c`: Implementation of a queue (Creation, Insertion, Deletion, Display) in C.
- **Linked List**
  - `linked_list.c`: Implementation of a singly linked list in C.
  - `doubly_linked_list.c`: Implementation of a doubly linked list in C.
  - `circular_linked_list.c`: Implementation of a circular linked list in C.
- **Binary Search Trees**
  - `BST.c`: Implementation of a Binary Search Tree (Creation, Insertion, Deletion, Display, Extra Functions) in C.
